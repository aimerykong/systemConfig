## 1. Install NVIDIA Graphics Driver via apt-get

Do not use the CUDA run file to install your driver. Use `apt-get` instead. This way you do not need to worry about the Nouveau stuff you read about on [StackOverflow](https://askubuntu.com/questions/799184/how-can-i-install-cuda-on-ubuntu-16-04).

As of 04/11/2018, the latest version of NVIDIA driver for Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS is 384. To install the driver, excute 

```sudo apt-get install nvidia-384 nvidia-modprobe```

, and then you will be prompted to disable Secure Boot. Select **Disable**. 

Reboot the machine but **enter BIOS to disable Secure Boot**. Typically you can enter BIOS by hitting F12 rapidly as soon as the system restarts.

Afterwards, you can check the Installation with the `nvidia-smi` command, which will report all your CUDA-capable devices in the system. 

### Common Errors and Solutions

1. `ERROR: Unable to load the 'nvidia-drm' kernel module.`
 * One probable reason is that the system is boot from UEFI but Secure Boot option is turned on in the BIOS setting. Turn it off and the problem will be solved. 

### Additional Notes 

`nvidia-smi -pm 1` can enable the persistent mode, which will save some time from loading the driver. It will have significant effect on machines with more than 4 GPUs. 

`nvidia-smi -e 0` can disable ECC on TESLA products, which will provide about 1/15 more video memory. Reboot is reqired for taking effect. `nvidia-smi -e 1` can be used to enable ECC again. 

`nvidia-smi -pl <some power value>` can be used for increasing or decrasing the TDP limit of the GPU. Increasing will encourage higher GPU Boost frequency, but is somehow DANGEROUS and HARMFUL to the GPU. Decreasing will help to same some power, which is useful for machines that does not have enough power supply and will shutdown unintendedly when pull all GPU to their maximum load. 

`-i <GPUID>` can be added after above commands to specify individual GPU. 

These commands can be added to `/etc/rc.local` for excuting at system boot. 

## 2. Install CUDA 9.0

Installing CUDA from runfile is much simpler and smoother than installing the NVIDIA driver. It just involves copying files to system directories and has nothing to do with the system kernel or online compilation. Removing CUDA is simply removing the installation directory. So I personally does not recommend adding NVIDIA's repositories and install CUDA via `apt-get` or other package managers as it will not reduce the complexity of installation or uninstallation but increase the risk of messing up the configurations for repositories. 

The CUDA runfile installer can be downloaded from [NVIDIA's websie](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads), or using wget in case you can't find it easily on NVIDIA:

```
cd
wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/9.0/Prod/local_installers/cuda_9.0.176_384.81_linux-run
```

What you download is a package the following three components: 

1. an NVIDIA driver installer, but usually of stale version;
2. the actual CUDA installer;
3. the CUDA samples installer;

I suggest extracting the above three components and executing 2 and 3 separately (remember we installed the driver ourselves already). To extract them, execute the runfile installer with `--extract` option:

```
cd
chmod +x cuda_9.0.176_384.81_linux-run
./cuda_9.0.176_384.81_linux-run --extract=$HOME
```

You should have unpacked three components:
`NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-384.81.run` (1. NVIDIA driver that we ignore),
`cuda-linux.9.0.176-22781540.run` (2. CUDA 9.0 installer), and
`cuda-samples.9.0.176-22781540-linux.run` (3. CUDA 9.0 Samples).

Execute the second one to install the CUDA Toolkit 9.0:

```
sudo ./cuda-linux.9.0.176-22781540.run
```

You now have to accept the license by scrolling down to the bottom (hit the "d" key on your keyboard) and enter "accept". Next accept the defaults.

To verify our CUDA installation, install the sample tests by

```
sudo ./cuda-samples.9.0.176-22781540-linux.run
```

After the installation finishes, configure the runtime library. 

```
sudo bash -c "echo /usr/local/cuda/lib64/ > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf"
sudo ldconfig
```

It is also recommended for Ubuntu users to append string `/usr/local/cuda/bin` to system file `/etc/environment` so that `nvcc` will be included in `$PATH`. This will take effect after reboot. To do that, you just have to

```
sudo vim /etc/environments
```

and then add `:/usr/local/cuda/bin` (including the ":") at the end of the PATH="/blah:/blah/blah" string (inside the quotes). 

After a `reboot`, let's test our installation by making and invoking our tests:
```
cd /usr/local/cuda-9.0/samples
sudo make
```

It's a long process with many irrelevant warnings about deprecated architectures (`sm_20` and such ancient GPUs). After it completes, run `deviceQuery` and `p2pBandwidthLatencyTest`:

```
cd /usr/local/cuda/samples/bin/x86_64/linux/release
./deviceQuery
```

The result of running `deviceQuery` should look something like this:

```
./deviceQuery Starting...

```

Cleanup: if ./deviceQuery works, remember to `rm` the 4 files (1 downloaded and 3 extracted). 

## Install cuDNN 7.0

The recommended way for installing cuDNN is to 

1. Download the "cuDNN v7.0.5 Library for Linux" `tgz` file (need to register for an Nvidia account).

2. `sudo mv` the downloaded archive to `/usr/local`. This might seem silly at first, but when you unzip it next you will see that the contents end up going to various folders under `/usr/local/cuda` and would be messy to move otherwise.

3. Then `cd /usr/local` and extract the `tgz` by

```
sudo tar -xvzf cudnn-9.0-linux-x64-v7.tgz
```

4. Finally, execute `sudo ldconfig` to update the shared library cache.

5. Clean up now or later by `sudo rm cudnn-9.0-linux-x64-v7.tgz`



Add path to .bashrc file accordingly--
```
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-9.0
```
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
```
export PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
```
